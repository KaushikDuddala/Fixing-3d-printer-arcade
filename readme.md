basically went through the guide from ellis3dp.com (which i very much recommend, it was very extensive and gave me plenty of details on how to do each step)
also hit some points that have been annoying me for a while, heres a list of everything i did:

fixing the issues with the extruder motor mount (fixing up mount issues d0d1bcc): i fixed an issue that's annoyed me for a while where this mount i added for direct drive (but never actually put the motor on) was hitting the frame of the printer and messing up bed leveling and would've messed up any large prints. to fix this i just grabbed a soldering iron and melted through the area that was hitting it and testing with leveling to make sure it wasn't hitting after. i do think theres still some slight rubbing against the frame but no actual consequences so i'll leave it as is for now.

tuning esteps ( ee9fdce ): don't have much images for this one but basically just tuned esteps according to ellis3dp's guide which basically says to take off the Bowden tube (or simply deattach from the hotend) tell the printer to extrude 100mm, and measure to ensure that 100mm was actually pushed out. it did overextrude quite a bit which was probably because i literally chose a random value when i installed klipper and just kept whatever worked (i believe this was around 22 and after tuning it was around 18)

first layer squish test ( f74730f ): again, following ellis3dp on this one and i used the first layer squish model that they provided and attempted to offset z live based on what i was seeing with each square to get that just right amount but i kept having issues where it would be inconsistent which i'll get to in the next one

more first layer squish ( 63a6f43 ): went through more first layer squish and eventually realized the issue i was having with inconsistency this entire time was because of a really simple issue: leveling!!! so i leveled the printer properly this time, made sure all of the screws were good and level, and then did it and it was going well and i think i got a good value

g29 fix and debugging buzzing noise (7a88a0a): basically started having an issue where my printer would buzz really loud all the time and like if i touched any part of the printer it would be vibrating and eventually narrowed it down to being the fan and found that some of the screws were a little loose ( probably because of my rinky dinky fan shroud) so whenever the fan would be on it would be hitting the screw over and over. also found that oops my right part cooling fan was facing the wrong way and was not in fact doing any part cooling!!! also got tired of the printer leveling every print like whenever a print would fail and i would have to run it again and it would level so i changed g29 to just load the leveling profile and a different level macro.

first layer and add buffer zone to mesh (79aa8b): that "slight rubbing against the frame" over in fixing the mount did end up actually having issues as i found that when it was leveling the far right side the mount would rub against the frame and would end up messing up that entire corner in terms of leveling and i was too tired to whip out the soldering iron again so what i did was i added a little buffer zone to the mesh so it wouldn't have that dip zone that it didn't need as it was only in the wrong position when it was moving up and down, something it wouldn't be doing while printing in that area. had to retune first layer as that dip zone did change it up a bit.

pressure advance (739f124): pressure advance sure was a fun one as i had a bunch of issues. first, ellis3dp has this nice little tool to make the gcode files without slicing it yourself for this one buuut that ended up conflicting with a layer plugin that i had on octoprint and that plugin wouldn't let me print the file because it was missing some verbose stuff so after some research i had to manually go thru the gcode and change the way it marked layer changes. after that, after all my first layer tuning, the plain frame pressure advance test ended up having some issues with sticking to the bed and i changed to the one that filled in the bottom, as seen in the second photo. it worked fine it was a little questionable bc if you look at the left side it looks like it was overextruding but it seemed fine on the right so im assuming thats just part of pressure advance and i eventually chose a value around 0.6 iirc (i'm writing this a while after doing it)

accel/speed testing (0277dbf): went to the next step in ellis3dp and started using the macro they provided to test my speed. went through it nice and slow starting at around 1000 and ramping it up but i was being kinda lazy andddd that mount back in the first commit decided to cause more issues as turns out everything else i ran so far on the printer didn't go all the way to the right but the test speed one would go allll the way and so it made it impossible to track if it was actually skipping or not since the position would always be off after it rammed into the side but i just would listen and if i could hear it i assumed it was skipping. i ended up deciding that the toolhead could go to 9000 mm/s while the bed capped at around 7000 mm/s. i'll get to this stuff later in fixing test speed dead zone

input shaping (2863164): used klippers guide on input shaping (which i have to say was very confusing and took me a while to actually understand it) and tried the towers with klippers weird gcode things that i didn't really understand but i think they worked. found that my max accel from earlier was actually wrong!!! i started having layer shifts mainly on the bed which makes sense as it had a lower max. found i also did not have much resonance in the first place as it was baaarely visible so i ended up not setting any input shaping values (later i did have some issues while i printed with a full roll probably because my white roll didn't have much left0

fixing test speed dead zone (47e37df) : went through all the conf files and macros and fixed the issue where it would ram into the side basically just tested what deadzone would be fine and also didn't realize it was adjusting the y bed for a while and not x so ya

min and max accel more testing (d4b90a1): went through and actually tested accels again (times on phone are grouped because i redid some of the tests later just for the picture) and this time i was actually able to use the homing stuff to see if it was skipping and found i had a max around 7000

tuning prusa mini (1d13dfe): this was obviously a different printer and not the ender but decided to group it in since i didn't wanna make a scrapbook with only like 2 hours but it's my FTC teams printer. we wanna be able to go faster and have more accurate prints so spent some time trying to tune it and this hour was spent trying to get the basics on pressure adnvace and i described most of what i did in the thread so ill just paste that here, "started doing pressure advance tuning but issue was that the frame i used for my ender didnt really work here and i think it was a first layer issue so i tried tower which was kinda useful, will narrow down more later"

tuning prusa (36d738c): got through with all the pressure advance which took a while and then moved onto flow tuning and found i actually needed 120% rather than 100%, here's what i said in the thread too: "got it narrowed down and i think i got a good value and imthen i dipped into flow tuning a little and found that i actuallt needed 120% not 100%"

writing readme!!: this current hour!! basically went through each hour so far and described what i did as you can see above but i am writing this quite a while after soo it was a little difficult and i think this file is starting to top 7800 characters!!!!!!!!! < that last question mark got me to 7800 and now this is 7862
